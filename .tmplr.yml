steps:
  #
  # Read the name of the repo owner
  # It might be set by Github workflow as an environment variable,
  # or it might be set in local git settings.
  # If all fails, we will simply ask the user.
  #
  - read: owner_name
    from: env.owner_name
    fallback:
      from: git.author_name
      fallback:
        prompt: What is your name?

  #
  # Figure out user's email. Same process as their name.
  #
  - read: owner_email
    from: env.owner_email
    fallback:
      from: git.author_email
      fallback:
        prompt: What is your email address?

  #
  # Similar to name and email of the owner of the repo. However,
  # if we're not invoked via an Action and there is no local git,
  # then we'll just use the directory name as the project name.
  #
  - read: repo_name
    from: env.repo_name
    fallback:
      from: git.remote_name
      fallback:
        from: filesystem.rootdir
 
  #
  # So if the remote url cannot be figured out, we
  # construct it using the owner name and repo name. This
  # is for illustration purposes and might be wrong (e.g. the
  # repo is not hosted on github).
  #
  - read: repo_url
    from: env.repo_url
    fallback:
      from: git.remote_url
      fallback:
        eval: 'git@github.com/{{ owner_name }}/{{ repo_name }}.git'

  #
  # Copy the README template file. Will automatically
  # replace all variables we "read" above while copying.
  #
  - copy: template/README.md
    to: README.md
   
  - remove: template/
  - remove: LICENSE
